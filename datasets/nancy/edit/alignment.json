     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-018-01.wav": "The factors include the impact of human longevity on how long marriages can be and what they can be like; the effects of changes in sickness and health as people live longer and age later; and the resulting need to eventually give or receive care. ",

     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-024-01.wav": "We know that science and technology-based longevity are what have made these long lives and marriages possible. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-024-02.wav": "During the last century, almost thirty years have been added to the expected lifespan, and the possible duration of marriage has been virtually doubled. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-024-03.wav": "Indeed, many of these couples have now been married forty, fifty, sixty, or even more years, which is longer than people used to live only a few generations ago! ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-025-00.wav": "These long-term marriages are unique to today's older generation because of the special confluence of longevity and monogamy. ",

     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-025-02.wav": "Such long-term marriages did not occur in the last generation and may not in the next one for vastly different reasons. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-026-00.wav": "In the previous generation, most men and women stayed married to each other as long as they lived, but they did not live long enough to celebrate such advanced anniversaries. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-026-01.wav": "For them, the so-called silver anniversary, twenty-five years, was long-term; more was not expected and was not usual. ",

     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-030-00.wav": "That means they will probably not be able to celebrate wedding anniversaries of forty, fifty, or more years unless they add together the different years of their separate marriages! ",

     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-031-01.wav": "The previous generation experienced monogamy without longevity, and it appears that the next generation will have the reverse. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-032-00.wav": "It is obvious that longevity has altered the number of years possible in people's lives and marriages, but what is less obvious is that longevity also has altered the very nature of those years. ",

     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-032-03.wav": "They bring new and different circumstances and they change old and expected ones. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-033-00.wav": "For example, there are certain important normal developmental changes that, in the past, occurred during the final years of marriage. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-033-01.wav": "These changes are the end of full-time parenting, when children grow up and go off into separate adult lives, and the end of full-time working, when men and women retire from their out-of-home jobs and careers. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-033-02.wav": "In the previous generation, there were few years left in people's lifetimes after these normal developmental changes occurred. ",

     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-053-02.wav": "Also, aging men have more difficulty dealing with physical changes, especially those related to signs of weakness or impotence. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-053-03.wav": "Perhaps because so much of their self-image and self-esteem is connected to their sense of strength and power, they see doctors later or less, since to do otherwise would be to acknowledge weakness. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-053-04.wav": "In addition, it is extremely difficult for men to accept chronic health conditions; they do better in situations of acute illness, which, though sometimes more drastic, may still offer the possibility of a solution or a quick fix or a chance of change. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-054-00.wav": "Men are also particularly unlikely to have emotional or social supports outside of their families, specifically their wives, or even to seek those supports when they suffer illness. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-054-01.wav": "In fact, the acknowledgment of any need for emotional help may be even more difficult for men than acknowledging the need for medical help because it seems more damaging to self-esteem. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-055-00.wav": "On the other hand, women may be able to turn to doctors more regularly and easily because, as mothers, they have been accustomed to taking care of the health needs of their children and families over the years. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-055-02.wav": "Furthermore, since women have been accustomed to providing emotional support in their roles as family nurturers, they are more able and willing to seek emotional support for themselves when they feel it may be needed or helpful. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-055-03.wav": "In other words, women seek doctors or other kinds of resources more than men do and for more health problems, and men die younger. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-056-00.wav": "There have also been a number of illuminating research studies about health and aging and about gender and aging. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-056-01.wav": "One recent medical finding is that for older men, there seems to be a correlation between the emergence of health problems and permanent retirement from life work or profession. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-056-02.wav": "So it may be that while men are still feeling in a positive role as wage earners and producers, and receiving gratification from this, they may be more able to mask or deny or sublimate health symptoms. ",

     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-061-00.wav": "It was not that in the past some kind of caretaking was never needed, but the older generation did not usually live long enough to require it for long. ",

     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-061-03.wav": "The responsibility may have been regretted or even resented, but nevertheless it was expected and accepted. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-062-00.wav": "There were several practical reasons for this in addition to any sense of family or moral obligation. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-062-01.wav": "First of all, this was before the days of an easy mobility that physically separated parents and children. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-062-02.wav": "Indeed, the generations remained geographically close to each other, usually living in the same community, the same neighborhood, sometimes even in the same home. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-062-03.wav": "As a result, families were close-knit and close by. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-063-00.wav": "Indeed, today's easy mobility has produced geographical separation. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-063-02.wav": "The result is that, no matter how caring or concerned these children may be and usually are, they are too far away to be readily available, except for occasional crisis intervention. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-063-03.wav": "They are not close enough physically to provide ongoing care. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-064-00.wav": "There is another difference between caretaking then and now. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-064-01.wav": "Before the days of women's independent work or careers, daughters were usually available as homemakers. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-064-02.wav": "They simply added parental caretaking to their other regular family responsibilities. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-064-03.wav": "Today, families are usually smaller in number than in the past, with two or three children being most typical, so fewer grown children now are available for assistance, and among those adult children, the daughters and the sons are equally employed or preoccupied outside the home. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-066-01.wav": "In contrast, today's older people need both more and less care than in the previous generation. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-066-02.wav": "They need less because medical improvements are keeping them stronger longer; they need more because they live longer with chronic conditions that require care longer. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-067-00.wav": "Still another important reason for the change in caretaking responsibility is that today's older generation has long taught and sought independence, both for themselves and for their children. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-067-02.wav": "So in a sense, they intentionally freed their children from the burden of parental obligation that they themselves had endured. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-067-03.wav": "During their own younger or adult years, this was not difficult and was even satisfying. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-067-04.wav": "But when they reached their older years and began to feel or expect the need for care, they also began to feel some regrets about the lessons of freedom from responsibility that they had taught and their children had learned so well! ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-069-00.wav": "The need to take care, or to be taken care of, in the later years of lasting marriages may be inevitable, but how the need is met is far from the same in all situations. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-069-01.wav": "There are differences in marital relationships, in individual personalities, in the nature of the particular problems, in the resources available, and in which spouse is the primary patient or caretaker. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-069-02.wav": "The caretakers may have health changes or problems of their own, but these are, as yet, less limiting and more manageable than the spouse's. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-069-03.wav": "So for almost all couples, the differences in health conditions are obvious enough to clearly define which spouse gives the caretaking and which spouse receives it. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-070-00.wav": "In either case, caretaking actually consists of two different but related kinds of responsibilities. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-070-01.wav": "One responsibility involves direct patient care, the providing of food, medication, assistance, comforting. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-070-02.wav": "The other involves taking over the patient's former household functions. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-070-03.wav": "The extent of the second depends on the first: the more care the spouse requires, the less he or she will be able to perform former household functions. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-071-00.wav": "Interestingly, it is the second set of duties rather than the direct helping that caretakers find more onerous. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-071-01.wav": "Perhaps they are not accustomed to the given tasks or do not feel competent about doing them. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-071-03.wav": "Or perhaps having those particular tasks reinforces the sense of loss of what the other spouse had formerly done or been in the marriage. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-072-00.wav": "Among these long-married caretaking couples, four patterns can be discerned, each with its own special arrangements, expectations, possibilities, and challenges, and also each with its own experiences and stories. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-072-01.wav": "These are wives taking care of husbands; husbands taking care of wives; wives and husbands taking care of each other; and not yet caretakers. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-073-00.wav": "This first group is numerically the largest, primarily due to gender differences in health and aging, as previously discussed. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-073-01.wav": "In addition, customarily the women were younger than the men when they married, with two or five years being the usual age difference. ",

     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-074-00.wav": "In some ways, wives who take care of their husbands may find it easier than how husbands experience taking care of their wives. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-074-01.wav": "For a wife in the current older generation, spousal caretaking may almost seem to be a variation or extension of her nurturing role in the family all along. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-074-02.wav": "She has already been accustomed to being the provider of food, medication, support, attention, and affection. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-074-03.wav": "So the specific skills and practical knowledge required are not new or unknown, even though this is a new kind of caretaking for her. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-077-00.wav": "Sometimes, although usually not at first, caretaking wives have turned to adult sons or sons-in-law for advice or assistance with what had formerly been men's tasks. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-077-01.wav": "But they have done so reluctantly and usually not until their husbands conditions noticeably lasted or worsened. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-077-02.wav": "Until then, most wives have tried to do everything themselves. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-079-00.wav": "First of all, nurturing and tending have not been things that men of the current older generation customarily have done, were expected to do, wanted to do, or were comfortable doing. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-079-01.wav": "It is not that these men do not care about their wives and families, but they have defined taking care in terms of their own masculine skills of organization, management, and efficiency. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-079-02.wav": "These are the skills they have been comfortable using and have tried to apply in taking care of their wives. ",

     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-080-00.wav": "Second, domestic household tasks will have been handled by the wives. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-080-01.wav": "In fact, cleaning rooms, doing the laundry, shopping for groceries, and making meals were actually looked down upon by most of the husbands. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-080-02.wav": "They often carefully avoided those tasks through preoccupation in their own tasks or through assumed helplessness in the kitchen or laundry room. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-081-00.wav": "Third, the wives usually will have been the social managers of the families, making and maintaining friends, entertaining and accepting invitations, arranging activities with others. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-081-01.wav": "Few of today's caretaking husbands feel they have the skill or experience or even the energy and patience to try to learn. ",
     "./datasets/nancy/audio/HAW-081-02.wav": "Instead, they find themselves relying increasingly for company on adult children who live nearby, or they remain without much social companionship or activities. ",
